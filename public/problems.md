### Factory Method Design Pattern

**Problem Statement:**
The Factory Method pattern addresses the problem of creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Class Instantiation Needs to Be De-coupled from Implementation:**
   - The code that creates objects should be separated from the code that uses the objects, promoting loose coupling and easier maintenance.

2. **Dynamic Decision on Object Creation:**
   - The type of object to be created needs to be determined at runtime based on some configuration, parameters, or other considerations. For example, different products or variations of a product might need to be instantiated based on user input or environment settings.

3. **Handling a Family of Related Objects:**
   - When you have a group of related products that share a common interface or base class, and you want to create instances of these products without having to know the exact subclass that needs to be instantiated.

4. **Incorporating New Products Without Changing Existing Code:**
   - When new types of products are added to the system, the existing code does not need to be modified. Instead, you can introduce new subclasses and override the factory method to create instances of these new subclasses.

**Example Scenario:**
Imagine you are developing a notification system that sends out various types of notifications (email, SMS, push notifications). The Factory Method pattern can be used to create the appropriate notification object based on the type of notification to be sent, without the client code needing to know about the specific classes of these notifications.

---

### Abstract Factory Design Pattern

**Problem Statement:**
The Abstract Factory pattern addresses the problem of creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Managing Families of Related Objects:**
   - You need to create groups of related objects that are designed to work together, and you want to ensure that your application always uses compatible objects.

2. **Enforcing Consistency Among Products:**
   - The system must ensure that objects from the same family are used together. For example, a GUI toolkit might need to ensure that all UI components (buttons, text fields, etc.) conform to a specific theme or style.

3. **Providing an Interface for Creating Families of Objects:**
   - You want to provide a common interface for creating families of related objects, allowing the client to use the interface to create a set of products without knowing the specific classes that will be instantiated.

4. **Making the System Independent of How Products are Created, Composed, and Represented:**
   - The system should be independent of the actual product classes that it uses. This is useful for adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle, which suggests that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a cross-platform UI toolkit that needs to support multiple operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux). The Abstract Factory pattern can be used to create UI components like buttons, text fields, and checkboxes that are specific to each operating system, ensuring that the components work consistently within each platform.

---

### Builder Design Pattern

**Problem Statement:**
The Builder pattern addresses the problem of constructing complex objects step by step, allowing for more flexibility in the creation process and ensuring that the final object is consistent and complete. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Creating Complex Objects with Many Parts:**
   - You need to construct an object that requires multiple steps and involves the assembly of various parts or components. Each step of the construction process might require different configurations or options.

2. **Separating Construction from Representation:**
   - The process of constructing an object should be separated from its representation. This allows the same construction process to create different representations or variants of the object.

3. **Avoiding a "Telescoping Constructor" Anti-pattern:**
   - When an object has numerous optional parameters, having a constructor with many parameters can lead to confusion and errors. The Builder pattern allows you to set optional parameters more clearly and flexibly.

4. **Providing Clear and Readable Object Construction:**
   - The construction of an object can be made more readable and maintainable by using a builder, which can set properties step by step with descriptive methods.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you need to create a customizable meal at a restaurant, with options for a main dish, side dish, drink, and dessert. The Builder pattern allows you to construct different meal combinations step by step, ensuring that each meal is complete and consistent, regardless of the specific choices made for each component.

---

### Prototype Design Pattern

**Problem Statement:**
The Prototype pattern addresses the problem of creating new objects by copying existing ones, which is particularly useful when:

1. **Creating Objects Based on a Prototype Instance:**
   - You need to create objects that are similar to an existing object. Instead of instantiating a new object from scratch, you can clone an existing object to ensure consistency and save on the cost of setting up a new instance.

2. **Avoiding the Cost of Initializing a New Object:**
   - The process of initializing an object can be costly in terms of resources or time. Cloning an existing object can be more efficient, especially if the new object will have many of the same properties as the existing one.

3. **Adding or Removing Objects at Runtime:**
   - You need the flexibility to add or remove objects at runtime without specifying their exact classes at compile time. The prototype can be registered and cloned as needed.

4. **Working with an Application that Uses a Large Number of Objects:**
   - When an application requires a large number of similar objects, the Prototype pattern can help manage memory usage and improve performance by reusing existing objects.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a graphic design application where users can create and edit various shapes (e.g., circles, rectangles, polygons). Each shape has properties like color, size, and position. The Prototype pattern allows users to duplicate existing shapes quickly, ensuring that the new shapes have the same properties as the originals, which can then be modified as needed.

---

### Singleton Design Pattern

**Problem Statement:**
The Singleton pattern addresses the problem of ensuring a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Ensuring a Single Instance:**
   - You need to ensure that only one instance of a class is created throughout the lifetime of an application. This is often necessary for resources that are expensive to create or that need to be coordinated globally, such as configuration settings, logging, or database connections.

2. **Providing a Global Access Point:**
   - There must be a global point of access to the instance. This allows various parts of the application to use the single instance without needing to pass around references.

3. **Controlling Access to Shared Resources:**
   - You need to control access to shared resources to avoid conflicts or inconsistencies. By ensuring only one instance, you can manage the resource in a centralized manner.

4. **Lazy Initialization:**
   - The instance should be created only when it is first needed, which helps in scenarios where resource allocation is expensive, and you want to delay the creation of the instance until absolutely necessary.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a logging utility in an application. You want to ensure that all parts of the application log messages through a single instance of the logger to ensure consistency and to avoid issues with multiple log files or duplicated log entries.

---

### Adapter Design Pattern

**Problem Statement:**
The Adapter pattern addresses the problem of incompatible interfaces by allowing objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Integrating with Legacy Code:**
   - You need to integrate new functionality with existing systems or legacy code that you cannot modify. The adapter acts as a bridge between the new code and the old code, ensuring compatibility without altering the existing interfaces.

2. **Reusing Existing Classes:**
   - You want to reuse existing classes but their interfaces are not compatible with the interfaces you need. The adapter allows you to create a new interface that your existing classes can work with.

3. **Converting Interfaces:**
   - You need to convert one interface into another that clients expect. This is particularly useful when you have multiple classes with similar functionality but different interfaces, and you want to provide a uniform interface for clients.

4. **Working with Incompatible Third-Party Libraries:**
   - You need to use third-party libraries or components that have interfaces incompatible with the rest of your application. The adapter can wrap these components, providing the expected interface and enabling smooth integration.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you have an application that uses a modern payment processing system, but you also need to integrate with an older payment gateway that has a different interface. The Adapter pattern can create a wrapper around the old payment gateway to make it compatible with the modern system's interface, allowing both systems to work together seamlessly.

---

### Bridge Design Pattern

**Problem Statement:**
The Bridge pattern addresses the problem of decoupling an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Separating Abstraction and Implementation:**
   - You need to separate an abstraction (interface) from its implementation so that both can be modified or extended independently without affecting each other. This promotes flexibility and scalability in the design.

2. **Avoiding Permanent Binding Between Abstraction and Implementation:**
   - You want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation. By using the Bridge pattern, you can change the implementation dynamically at runtime if necessary.

3. **Handling Complex Inheritance Structures:**
   - In complex systems, you might have multiple layers of abstraction and implementation. The Bridge pattern helps manage this complexity by allowing you to combine different abstractions with different implementations without creating a proliferation of subclasses.

4. **Supporting Multiple Dimensions of Variability:**
   - When you need to support multiple dimensions of variability (e.g., different types of objects that can be displayed in different ways), the Bridge pattern allows you to handle this variability in a structured manner.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you are developing a graphical application that supports multiple types of shapes (e.g., circles, rectangles) and multiple rendering APIs (e.g., OpenGL, DirectX). Using the Bridge pattern, you can define a shape abstraction and separate rendering implementations, allowing you to mix and match shapes with different rendering techniques without creating a large number of subclasses.

---

### Composite Design Pattern

**Problem Statement:**
The Composite pattern addresses the problem of treating individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Handling Hierarchical Data Structures:**
   - You need to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects. The Composite pattern allows you to build a tree structure of objects where individual objects (leaves) and compositions of objects (composites) can be treated uniformly.

2. **Uniformly Handling Single Objects and Compositions:**
   - You want clients to treat single objects and compositions of objects in the same way. This simplifies client code by eliminating the need for complex conditional logic to distinguish between different types of objects.

3. **Recursive Composition:**
   - You need to perform operations recursively over a hierarchy of objects. The Composite pattern makes it easy to apply an operation to an entire structure, allowing you to recursively traverse and operate on both individual objects and compositions.

4. **Managing Groups of Objects:**
   - You want to group objects into larger structures and manipulate them as a single unit. The Composite pattern enables you to define operations that can be performed on both individual components and whole compositions.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a graphical drawing application where you can create simple shapes like circles and rectangles, as well as complex shapes composed of multiple simple shapes. The Composite pattern allows you to treat both simple and complex shapes uniformly, enabling operations like moving, scaling, and rendering to be applied to any shape, regardless of its complexity.

---

### Decorator Design Pattern

**Problem Statement:**
The Decorator pattern addresses the problem of adding behavior to individual objects dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Adding Responsibilities to Objects Dynamically:**
   - You need to add responsibilities or functionalities to objects at runtime, and you want to avoid a proliferation of subclasses to handle every possible combination of behaviors.

2. **Extending Functionality Without Modifying Classes:**
   - You want to extend the functionality of a class without modifying the class itself. This helps in adhering to the Open/Closed Principle, which states that classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. **Combining Behaviors Flexibly:**
   - You need to combine different behaviors flexibly and dynamically. The Decorator pattern allows you to mix and match behaviors in a combinatorial way without creating an excessive number of subclasses.

4. **Keeping Classes Simple:**
   - You want to keep your classes simple by avoiding bloated classes with many features. Instead, you can create small, focused classes and use decorators to add features as needed.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you have a text editor application, and you want to add various functionalities such as spell checking, auto-correct, and text highlighting. Instead of creating multiple subclasses for each combination of functionalities, you can use the Decorator pattern to add these features to individual text components dynamically.

---

### Facade Design Pattern

**Problem Statement:**
The Facade pattern addresses the problem of simplifying the interaction with a complex system by providing a unified interface. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Reducing Complexity:**
   - You need to reduce the complexity of interacting with a subsystem that consists of multiple classes, interfaces, or APIs. The facade provides a simple interface to the complex subsystem.

2. **Hiding the Details of the Subsystem:**
   - You want to hide the details and intricacies of the subsystem from the client. This helps in decoupling the client code from the subsystem and makes the subsystem easier to use.

3. **Improving Code Readability and Maintainability:**
   - By providing a unified and simplified interface, you make the code more readable and easier to maintain. Clients interact with the facade rather than dealing with multiple components directly.

4. **Promoting Loose Coupling:**
   - The Facade pattern promotes loose coupling between the client and the subsystem. Changes in the subsystem do not affect the client as long as the facade interface remains unchanged.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you have a complex library for multimedia processing, with various classes and methods for decoding, rendering, and playing media files. A facade can provide a simple interface to these functionalities, allowing the client to easily play, pause, and stop media files without needing to understand the details of the underlying library.

---

### Flyweight Design Pattern

**Problem Statement:**
The Flyweight pattern addresses the problem of efficiently managing a large number of fine-grained objects that share a lot of common data. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Reducing Memory Usage:**
   - You need to minimize memory usage by sharing as much data as possible with other similar objects. This is especially important when working with a large number of objects that have many shared properties.

2. **Managing Large Numbers of Objects:**
   - You have a large number of objects that could potentially lead to high memory consumption. The Flyweight pattern helps manage these objects efficiently by reusing shared instances.

3. **Separating Intrinsic and Extrinsic State:**
   - You need to separate the intrinsic state (which can be shared) from the extrinsic state (which is unique to each object). The intrinsic state is stored in shared flyweight objects, while the extrinsic state is stored externally and passed to the flyweights when needed.

4. **Improving Performance:**
   - By reducing the number of objects created and reusing existing instances, you can improve the performance of your application, particularly in terms of memory allocation and garbage collection.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you are developing a text editor that needs to render large documents. Each character in the document can be represented as a flyweight object that shares common properties (such as font and style) while storing its unique position and other specific attributes externally. This approach significantly reduces the memory footprint compared to creating separate objects for each character with all attributes.

---

### Proxy Design Pattern

**Problem Statement:**
The Proxy pattern addresses the problem of controlling access to an object by providing a surrogate or placeholder for it. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Controlling Access:**
   - You need to control access to an object, which could involve restricting access, managing permissions, or adding additional functionality like logging or lazy initialization.

2. **Lazy Initialization:**
   - You want to delay the creation and initialization of an object until it is actually needed. This can improve performance and resource management, especially for objects that are expensive to create.

3. **Remote Access:**
   - You need to represent an object that exists in a different address space (e.g., on a different server or in a different process). The proxy provides a local representative for the remote object, managing communication between the client and the remote object.

4. **Logging and Auditing:**
   - You want to add logging, auditing, or other cross-cutting concerns without modifying the original object. The proxy can intercept calls to the original object and add the required behavior.

5. **Smart Reference:**
   - You need a smart reference to an object that performs additional actions when the object is accessed, such as reference counting, checking locks, or verifying object availability.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you are developing a virtual file system. Some files are stored locally, while others are stored on a remote server. A proxy can represent remote files locally, handling the communication with the remote server transparently. The proxy can also manage caching, access control, and logging, ensuring that remote file operations are efficient and secure.

---

### Chain of Responsibility

**Problem Statement:**
The Chain of Responsibility pattern addresses the problem of decoupling the sender of a request from its receiver by allowing multiple objects to process the request. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Handling Requests by Different Handlers:**
   - You need multiple objects to have a chance to handle a request, but you don't want to tightly couple the sender to the specific handler. Each handler can either handle the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.

2. **Dynamic Chain of Handlers:**
   - The chain of handlers needs to be dynamic and flexible. Handlers can be added, removed, or reordered without impacting the client code that sends the request.

3. **Processing Requests Based on Run-time Conditions:**
   - The appropriate handler for a request is determined at run-time. This allows for a flexible and extensible way to handle requests where the processing logic can change based on the request's state or type.

4. **Avoiding Monolithic Conditionals:**
   - You want to avoid large conditional statements or switch cases in your code that determine which handler should process the request. Instead, each handler can encapsulate its own condition and processing logic.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you have a support ticket system. Different levels of support (e.g., basic, intermediate, advanced) need to handle customer issues. The Chain of Responsibility pattern allows a ticket to be passed through different support levels until it is handled, without the client needing to know about the internal hierarchy of the support system.

---

### Command

**Problem Statement:**
The Command pattern addresses the problem of encapsulating a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations, and providing support for undoable operations. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Encapsulating Requests:**
   - You need to encapsulate all the information needed to perform an action or trigger an event at a later time. This includes the method to be called, the parameters to be passed, and the object that will perform the method.

2. **Queueing and Logging Requests:**
   - You want to queue requests, log them, or provide support for undoable operations. The Command pattern allows for the manipulation of these requests in a flexible and extensible manner.

3. **Parameterizing Objects with Operations:**
   - You need to parameterize objects with operations. This is useful for implementing callback functionality and passing around operations like first-class objects.

4. **Supporting Undo and Redo:**
   - You want to support undo and redo operations. By storing a history of commands, you can easily revert the state of an application to a previous state by undoing commands and reapply them by redoing commands.

5. **Decoupling Sender and Receiver:**
   - You need to decouple the object that invokes the operation from the object that performs the operation. This promotes loose coupling and greater flexibility in the design.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a text editor application where users can perform various actions such as typing text, deleting text, and formatting text. Each action can be encapsulated as a command object, allowing the application to queue commands, undo and redo actions, and log user activities.

---

### Iterator

**Problem Statement:**
The Iterator pattern addresses the problem of providing a way to access the elements of a collection sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Traversing Collections Uniformly:**
   - You need to traverse different types of collections (e.g., lists, trees, graphs) in a uniform manner. The Iterator pattern provides a standard interface for traversing elements, regardless of the collection's implementation.

2. **Encapsulating Iteration Logic:**
   - You want to encapsulate the iteration logic inside an iterator object, separating it from the collection's structure. This helps in adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle by keeping the collection's responsibilities focused on data storage and management.

3. **Supporting Multiple Iterations:**
   - You need to support multiple simultaneous iterations over a collection. The Iterator pattern allows you to create multiple iterator instances, each with its own traversal state.

4. **Providing Multiple Traversal Strategies:**
   - You want to provide different traversal strategies for a collection (e.g., forward, backward, depth-first, breadth-first). The Iterator pattern enables you to implement and use these strategies without modifying the collection's code.

5. **Hiding Implementation Details:**
   - You need to hide the implementation details of the collection from the client. The Iterator pattern allows clients to access elements without needing to know how the collection is structured internally.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you are developing a social media platform, and you need to iterate over a user's friend list, post history, and photo album. Each of these collections might have different internal structures, but the Iterator pattern allows you to traverse them uniformly and independently of their implementations.

---

### Mediator

**Problem Statement:**
The Mediator pattern addresses the problem of managing complex communications and dependencies between a set of objects. It helps to reduce the direct dependencies between objects by introducing a mediator object that handles the interactions. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Reducing Direct Dependencies:**
   - You need to reduce the direct dependencies between objects. When objects communicate directly with each other, changes in one object can have a ripple effect, causing issues in others. The Mediator pattern decouples these objects by introducing a mediator to handle their interactions.

2. **Simplifying Object Communication:**
   - You want to simplify the communication logic between multiple objects. The Mediator pattern centralizes the communication logic, making it easier to maintain and modify.

3. **Managing Complex Interactions:**
   - You need to manage complex interactions and control flows between multiple objects. The Mediator pattern provides a central point of control that can coordinate these interactions more effectively.

4. **Improving Code Maintainability:**
   - You aim to improve the maintainability of your code by reducing the tangled web of references between interacting objects. By centralizing communication in a mediator, changes to the interaction logic are localized to the mediator, making the system easier to understand and maintain.

5. **Promoting Reusability:**
   - You want to promote the reusability of individual components by decoupling them from their interactions with other components. Components can be reused in different contexts without needing to change their interaction logic.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you are developing a chat application with multiple components like User, ChatRoom, and Message. Each User should not communicate directly with other Users or ChatRooms. Instead, a Mediator (e.g., ChatRoomManager) handles the communication between users and chat rooms, managing who can send messages to whom and how messages are distributed.

---

### Memento

**Problem Statement:**
The Memento pattern addresses the problem of capturing and externalizing an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later, without violating encapsulation. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Supporting Undo and Redo:**
   - You need to implement undo and redo functionality in an application. The Memento pattern allows you to save and restore the state of objects at different points in time, enabling the application to revert to previous states.

2. **Preserving Encapsulation:**
   - You want to preserve the encapsulation of an object's state. The Memento pattern allows the state to be saved and restored without exposing the object's internals to other parts of the application.

3. **Saving State for Future Restoration:**
   - You need to save the state of an object for future restoration. This is useful in scenarios where the state needs to be checkpointed, such as in games, editors, or transactional systems.

4. **Managing State Histories:**
   - You want to manage state histories of objects, allowing for a series of changes to be tracked and potentially reverted. The Memento pattern can help maintain a history of states that can be navigated backward and forward.

5. **Reducing Complexity of State Management:**
   - You need to manage the complexity of state management by encapsulating the state-related operations. The Memento pattern provides a clear and structured way to handle state saving and restoring.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you are developing a text editor with features like undo and redo. Each time the user makes a change to the document, you can create a memento representing the current state of the document. When the user wants to undo a change, the editor can restore the document to a previous state using the saved memento.

---

### Observer

**Problem Statement:**
The Observer pattern addresses the problem of creating a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Maintaining Consistency Across Related Objects:**
   - You need to maintain consistency between related objects without tightly coupling them. When the state of one object changes, other dependent objects need to be updated to reflect this change.

2. **Decoupling Subject and Observers:**
   - You want to decouple the subject (the object being observed) from its observers (the objects that need to be notified of changes). This promotes loose coupling and allows the system to be more flexible and extensible.

3. **Supporting Multiple Observers:**
   - You need to support multiple observers that are interested in the state changes of a subject. The Observer pattern allows a subject to have any number of dependent observers that are notified of state changes.

4. **Facilitating Event-Driven Systems:**
   - You want to facilitate an event-driven system where certain objects need to react to changes or events occurring in other objects. The Observer pattern provides a mechanism for this kind of event-driven interaction.

5. **Improving Code Maintainability and Scalability:**
   - You aim to improve the maintainability and scalability of your code by separating the concerns of data (subject) and its dependencies (observers). This separation makes it easier to manage and extend the system.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you are developing a weather monitoring application with different display elements such as a current conditions display, a statistics display, and a forecast display. The weather data object (subject) needs to notify these displays (observers) whenever the weather data is updated, so each display can refresh its information.

---

### State

**Problem Statement:**
The State pattern addresses the problem of an object changing its behavior when its internal state changes, making the object appear to change its class. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Handling Object State Transitions:**
   - You need to manage an object that can change its behavior based on its internal state. Each state transition should result in a different behavior without using complex conditional logic.

2. **Encapsulating State-Specific Behavior:**
   - You want to encapsulate the state-specific behavior and state transitions within state objects rather than having it spread across the object's methods. This promotes cleaner code and separation of concerns.

3. **Simplifying Complex State Logic:**
   - You need to simplify complex state-dependent logic in an object. The State pattern breaks down state-specific behavior into separate classes, making it easier to manage and extend.

4. **Promoting Single Responsibility Principle:**
   - You want to adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle by allowing the context class to delegate state-specific behavior to state classes. Each state class handles the behavior associated with a particular state.

5. **Allowing State Transitions:**
   - You need to allow dynamic state transitions at runtime. The State pattern enables an object to change its state and behavior dynamically as events occur.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you are developing a TCP connection that can be in different states such as listening, connecting, established, and closed. Each state has its own behavior and transitions to other states. The State pattern allows you to manage these states and transitions more effectively by encapsulating state-specific behavior in separate classes.

---

### Strategy

**Problem Statement:**
The Strategy pattern addresses the problem of defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Defining a Family of Algorithms:**
   - You need to define a family of algorithms or behaviors and make them interchangeable. The Strategy pattern enables you to encapsulate each algorithm in a separate class and switch between them easily.

2. **Avoiding Conditional Statements:**
   - You want to avoid using complex conditional statements to select an algorithm at runtime. The Strategy pattern allows you to choose the appropriate algorithm dynamically, based on the context.

3. **Encapsulating Algorithm-Specific Code:**
   - You want to encapsulate algorithm-specific code in its own class, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle. This makes your codebase easier to maintain and extend.

4. **Promoting Code Reuse:**
   - You aim to promote code reuse by defining reusable strategies that can be applied in different contexts. Each strategy can be independently developed and tested.

5. **Allowing Dynamic Algorithm Changes:**
   - You need to change the algorithm used by an object at runtime. The Strategy pattern provides a flexible way to switch algorithms without modifying the client's code.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you are developing a payment processing system that needs to support multiple payment methods such as credit card, PayPal, and cryptocurrency. Each payment method can be encapsulated as a separate strategy, allowing the payment processing system to switch between different payment strategies dynamically based on user choice or configuration.

---

### Template Method

**Problem Statement:**
The Template Method pattern addresses the problem of defining the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. This allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. This is particularly useful when:

1. **Defining a Skeleton of an Algorithm:**
   - You need to define the overall structure or skeleton of an algorithm, with specific steps that can vary. The Template Method pattern provides a template for the algorithm, with placeholders for the variable steps.

2. **Enforcing a Common Algorithm Structure:**
   - You want to enforce a common structure for an algorithm across multiple subclasses, ensuring that the core logic is consistent while allowing variations in specific steps.

3. **Promoting Code Reuse:**
   - You aim to promote code reuse by putting the invariant parts of the algorithm in a base class, while allowing subclasses to implement the variant parts. This reduces code duplication and centralizes common logic.

4. **Avoiding Code Duplication:**
   - You want to avoid duplicating code across multiple subclasses that implement similar algorithms with minor variations. The Template Method pattern allows you to define the common structure once and let subclasses provide specific details.

5. **Ensuring Consistent Behavior:**
   - You need to ensure that certain steps of an algorithm are always executed in a specific order. The Template Method pattern enforces this order by defining it in the template method.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you are developing a data processing framework that needs to process different types of data sources (e.g., XML, JSON, CSV). The overall process might include steps like reading data, processing data, and writing data. The Template Method pattern allows you to define the skeleton of the data processing algorithm in a base class, with subclasses providing specific implementations for reading, processing, and writing different types of data.

---

### Visitor

**Problem Statement:**
The Visitor pattern addresses the problem of adding new operations to existing object structures without modifying the structures. It is particularly useful when:

1. **Performing Operations on Object Structures:**
   - You need to perform operations on objects that are part of a complex object structure, and these operations are not central to the objects' responsibilities.

2. **Adding Operations Without Modifying Classes:**
   - You want to add new operations to an object structure without modifying the classes of the elements on which the operations are performed. This helps to adhere to the Open/Closed Principle.

3. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - You need to separate the logic for operations from the object structure. By doing so, the objects remain focused on their primary responsibilities while the visitor handles the operations.

4. **Handling Multiple Distinct Operations:**
   - You need to handle multiple distinct operations on an object structure and want to avoid polluting the classes with these operations. The Visitor pattern allows you to encapsulate these operations in separate visitor classes.

5. **Working with Class Hierarchies:**
   - You have a class hierarchy, and you need to perform operations on objects of these classes in a way that depends on their concrete classes. The Visitor pattern allows the operation to be defined separately from the classes.

**Example Scenario:**
Consider a scenario where you are developing a document editor that supports various types of document elements like text, images, and tables. You need to implement multiple operations such as rendering, printing, and exporting to different formats. The Visitor pattern allows you to define these operations in separate visitor classes, enabling you to add new operations without modifying the document element classes.
