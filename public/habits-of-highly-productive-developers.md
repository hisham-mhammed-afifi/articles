**Habit 1: Look For The Signals**

In today’s world, developers are constantly overwhelmed with information from tweets, newsletters, and videos suggesting what to learn or focus on. This flood of information can lead to FOMO (fear of missing out) on the latest programming languages, frameworks, or tools.

The author shares a personal anecdote about choosing an operating system (OS). Initially using Windows, they were told to switch to Apple, then later to Ubuntu. Through these experiences, the key takeaway is that there isn’t a “best” tool; what matters is finding what works for you and your specific needs. This leads to practicing JOMO (joy of missing out), where one is content with their current knowledge and skills while balancing the need to learn new technologies.

Self-awareness is essential in distinguishing meaningful information (the signal) from the constant noise. Instead of abandoning social media or newsletters entirely, it’s about selectively focusing on what is relevant to your career at that time. Accept that it’s impossible to learn everything and that newer doesn’t always mean better. Saying ‘no’ to the newest trends allows you to focus on what truly matters.

To manage this, the author suggests creating a list of technologies and tools you’d like to learn, prioritizing them into categories like “This Week,” “Next Month,” and “Next Year.” Revisit and reorganize this list to stay on track.

**Industry Expert Insights:**

1. **Daniel Buchner (Microsoft):** He once explored every new framework but now focuses on three key criteria: technical requirements, ease of collaboration, and alignment with long-term standards. This approach filters out many distractions, saving time and effort.

2. **Addy Osmani (Google):** Emphasizes learning enough to be effective. When a new technology shows potential, he invests a short time to evaluate its impact on productivity and user experience. Making trade-offs based on finite time is crucial, as illustrated by his delayed adoption of React in favor of other technologies.

3. **Loiane Groner (Citibank):** Recommends asking questions to determine the relevance of new technologies: What problem does it solve? How does it differ from existing solutions? She highlights the importance of understanding a technology’s ecosystem and observing its adoption in production environments.

4. **Netto Farah (Segment):** Uses past experiences and gut feelings to evaluate new frameworks. He experiments with radical paradigm shifts before fully committing. Additionally, he considers the career benefits of learning a new tool, optimizing for the one that can advance his career.

**Habit 2: Focus On The Fundamentals**

The author recounts an experience from university in 2009, where Professor Mariano Pimentel required students to write HTML and CSS using Notepad. Despite the availability of advanced tools like Dreamweaver, Notepad's lack of syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and live preview forced the students to deeply understand the code they were writing. This challenging exercise ensured that the author internalized HTML tags and CSS properties, illustrating the long-lasting benefits of mastering the fundamentals.

The key takeaway is not to abandon modern code editors but to recognize the importance of learning the basics. Just as painters need to understand color theory, perspective, form, and anatomy, developers need to grasp core concepts such as algorithms, logic, networking, accessibility, security, and user experience. Mastering these fundamentals is essential for building complex applications and advancing as a developer.

To aid in this endeavor, the open source community has created roadmaps for DevOps, Front-end, and Back-end developers, available at 14habits.com/bonus/2.

**Action Plan:**

- **Research Fundamental Concepts:** Identify the core concepts relevant to your field.
- **Knowledge Assessment:** Create a two-column list: on the left, write what you already know; on the right, list what you need to learn.
- **Study Schedule:** Dedicate time daily to study these fundamentals.

**Industry Expert Insights:**

1. **Lais Andrade (Google):**

   - Approaches new languages similarly to new frameworks by understanding key concepts and finding examples of problem-solving techniques.
   - Applies new languages directly to projects, using peer reviewers for guidance.
   - Emphasizes the importance of understanding everything written and the theory behind it.

2. **Fabio Costa (GoDaddy, Ex-Facebook):**

   - Recommends rewriting an existing pet project in a new programming language to focus solely on learning the language.
   - Avoids starting completely new projects to keep the focus on the language rather than additional features or documentation.

3. **Michael Lancaster (BlackBerry):**
   - Emphasizes continuous practice (Always Be Coding).
   - Dedicates at least one hour daily for 30 consecutive days to learn a new language.
   - Utilizes YouTube tutorials, official documentation, unit tests, and popular open source projects to build a strong foundation.

**Habit 3: Teaching Equals Learning**

The author begins by sharing their experience of giving 100 presentations at developer conferences across 16 countries and 71 cities, flying a total of 712,575 miles. Despite these impressive numbers, the author admits to still feeling fear before every presentation, highlighting their introverted nature and past shyness.

The core message is encapsulated in a phrase from the author’s father: “If you really want to learn something, you have to teach it.” Teaching forces you to thoroughly understand and memorize the material, and the best way to do this is by teaching in public. Though challenging and often intimidating, public teaching is highly effective for deep learning.

There are various ways to teach others, such as sharing links on social media, writing blog posts, recording screencasts, or giving talks. The author prefers giving talks despite the common fear of public speaking. They describe a recurring pattern in their speaking experiences:

1. **Act 1 – The invitation:** An event organizer invites you to speak, you accept, and life continues as usual.
2. **Act 2 – Reality settles in:** As the event approaches, you panic about not having started on your presentation.
3. **Act 3 – Freaking out:** The week of the conference, you regret accepting the invitation but find the motivation to complete the preparation.
4. **Act 4 – The moment of truth:** On the day of the talk, anxiety peaks, but you face the audience and deliver your presentation.
5. **Act 5 – Let’s do it again:** Post-presentation, you feel relieved and accomplished, leading to future speaking engagements.

Teaching not only benefits the audience but also significantly enhances the teacher’s own understanding and confidence. The author encourages readers to start teaching through online events, screen recordings, blog posts, or any chosen topic.

**Action Plan:**

- **Find an event and submit a presentation.**
- **Record yourself doing something and share it.**
- **Create a blog and share an article.**
- **Choose a topic, learn it, and teach it.**

**Industry Expert Insights:**

1. **Fernando Tadashi (Adobe):**

   - Regularly presents to clients, enhancing technical knowledge and self-control, especially in stressful situations.

2. **Loiane Groner (Citibank):**

   - Over ten years of public speaking and teaching have greatly benefited her career, providing opportunities for travel, networking, and deepening her understanding of various technologies.

3. **Addy Osmani (Google):**

**Habit 4: Be Boring**

In the software world, intensity is often praised. Stories of spending all night programming tend to impress others, and there is admiration for those who go the extra mile. However, this intensity can easily lead to burnout. While extra hours might be necessary for specific deadlines or emergencies, making it a regular practice is unsustainable and counterproductive.

The author emphasizes the importance of balance and highlights that consistent, disciplined, and persistent work habits are key to long-term success. They introduce the concept of finite and infinite games, as explained by philosopher James Carse in his book _Finite and Infinite Games_.

**Finite Games:**

- Known players, fixed rules, and specific objectives (e.g., soccer).
- The goal is to win within a set timeframe.

**Infinite Games:**

- Known and unknown players, changeable rules, and the objective is to keep playing.
- There are no winners or losers, and the game continues as long as players have the will and resources to participate (e.g., marriage, programming).

Programming is an infinite game. The players are always changing as new programmers enter the field, and the rules evolve with new paradigms, patterns, and bugs. The objective is continuous improvement, not a definitive victory.

**Consistent vs. Intense Approach:**

- Programmers who focus on short-term gains (finite game) may experience burnout.
- Those who embrace consistency and discipline (infinite game) focus on long-term improvement and sustainability.

The author advocates for "being boring" by adopting disciplined routines, prioritizing consistency, and avoiding the allure of intense but unsustainable work habits.

**Action Plan:**

- Reflect on whether you are playing a finite or infinite game.
- Assess the balance between pursuing short-term gains and investing in long-term outcomes.

**Industry Expert Insights:**

1. **Luciano Sousa (Shopify):**

   - Learned the importance of having a good schedule and avoiding procrastination from colleagues with disciplined work habits.
   - Encourages a balanced, straightforward daily work pattern.

2. **Berg Brandt (Amazon, Ex-Yahoo):**

   - Values high integrity in professionals, demonstrated through consistent, goal-oriented behavior.
   - Integrity includes focusing on the right outcomes, addressing issues proactively, and helping find solutions during challenges.

3. **Caio Gondim (New York Times):**

   - Reliability and consistency are essential traits of the best programmers.
   - They avoid overworking, understand the importance of rest, and account for realistic work conditions.

4. **Blake Williams (GitHub):**
   - Observed that the best programmers are extremely disciplined.
   - Discipline includes writing great code, comprehensive testing, clear communication, and a pragmatic approach to problem-solving.
   - This disciplined approach reduces the need for rushed work and allows for steady, quality improvements.

**Habit 5: Do It For Your Future Self**

The author discusses the importance of writing code with the future in mind. They emphasize that even the best programmers have written poor code at times due to various circumstances such as pressure or deadlines. This poor quality is not necessarily due to a lack of knowledge but rather the situational context during that period.

The author recounts an experience of working on a side project without any external pressure, leading to well-written, maintainable, and easy-to-understand code. However, when revisiting the project a year later, the code was unrecognizable. This highlights the importance of writing code not just for the present but with the future self in mind. Key practices include:

- **Readable Code:** Avoid clever tricks and focus on readability.
- **Meaningful Names:** Use meaningful names for classes, functions, and variables.
- **Maintainability:** Think about how easy it will be to maintain and evolve the code in the future.
- **Future Self:** Ask yourself, “Will the future me understand the intention of this code?”

**Action Plan:**

- Review a current project for opportunities to refactor and improve readability for the future self.

**Industry Expert Insights:**

**Habit 6: Your 9-to-5 Is Not Enough**

The concept of a "9-to-5" job refers to the traditional full-time work schedule. A "9-to-5 programmer" is someone who works within these hours and leaves work behind at the end of the day. Throughout their career, the author has encountered many 9-to-5 programmers. Some are brilliant and focused, while others see programming merely as a means to earn money and prioritize other hobbies.

The author acknowledges that everyone has the right to use their free time as they wish. However, they strongly believe that a successful career in tech requires investing extra hours into learning and improving your craft. Unlike other professions, where additional work outside of official hours may not be expected, programming often necessitates personal time to explore new technologies and expand one’s skill set.

The author emphasizes that your regular job might not provide enough opportunities to showcase your full potential due to technological constraints and company standards. Therefore, dedicating extra time to learning new languages, frameworks, and best practices is crucial, especially for those at the beginning of their careers.

While the author does not advocate sacrificing sleep or personal responsibilities, they suggest that it is possible to balance relaxation and productivity. For example, one can watch Netflix, play video games, and still work on open source projects or read books. The key is to manage time effectively and integrate learning into daily routines.

**Action Plan:**

- Identify skills that need improvement.
- Allocate extra time, even just 10 minutes a day, to develop these skills.

**Industry Expert Insights:**

**Habit 7: Master The Dark Side**

Historically, programming was a highly selective field limited to those who could afford a specialized education. However, today, software development has become more accessible, with millions of developers worldwide. Despite this accessibility, one thing remains rare: developers who understand the business side of things.

Developers act as translators, converting user requirements into functionalities. In some companies, detailed user stories and acceptance criteria are provided, allowing developers to focus solely on coding. However, in reality, extracting information from key stakeholders can be challenging due to differing understandings of the system.

Initially, the author viewed clients and salespeople as adversaries, seeing them as uninterested in code quality. Over time, they realized that understanding the business side could significantly enhance their work. The author highlights three key benefits of mastering the business side:

1. **Save Time:**

**Habit 8: Side Projects**

When considering the most successful products today, it's easy to think of unicorn startups with significant financial support and large teams. However, some of the most well-known platforms, like Twitter, Craigslist, and Slack, started as side projects.

People embark on side projects for various reasons beyond creating a new product or building a successful company. Whether you are starting your career or are already established, side projects offer numerous benefits:

1. **For Beginners:**

   - Build your portfolio.
   - Enhance your résumé.
   - Showcase your skills.

2. **For Established Professionals:**
   - Learn new skills that might not be part of your daily work.

**Habit 14: Stop Waiting**

One common trait among all humans is the feeling of never being fully satisfied with life. Regardless of one's socioeconomic status, there is always something to aspire to or something to improve. This dissatisfaction can lead to thoughts like:

- "My job sucks, I need to work somewhere else..."
- "This country is hopeless, I need to leave it asap..."
- "I have an incredible idea, I need to put it into practice..."

While wanting a better future is natural and drives progress, the problem arises when these thoughts are followed by excuses:

- "...but I'm afraid of changing."
- "...but I don't know another language."
- "...but I don't have time."

The primary obstacle to achieving goals is often oneself. Many recognize what bothers them but lack the courage and determination to tackle these challenges head-on.

### Overcoming Excuses:

**Changing Jobs:**

- Identify the companies you want to work for.
- Count how many times you have interviewed at each.
- Determine the skills needed for the job.
- Read books and take courses to fill skill gaps.

**Living Abroad:**

- Dedicate time each week to learn the language of the desired country.
- Save money monthly for moving costs.
- Research the type of visa needed and the required documents.

**Investing in an Idea:**
